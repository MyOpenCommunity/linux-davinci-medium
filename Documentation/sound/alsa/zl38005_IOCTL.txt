Intro
=====

 ZLS38501 is the firmware that runs on the ZL38005 (Advanced Acoustic Echo
 Canceller with Noise Reduction) hardware platform to realize audio
 applications requiring acoustic echo cancellation and noise reduction.
 This firmware and hardware combination is a hands free communication
 processor that is ideal for Hands-free Car Kit applications.

Driver Status
=============

The driver is stable.
The driver have a lot of ioctl API to modify ZL38005 register and for firmware
upload and upgrade.
The driver has also the alsa ASoC interface for CONTROLS and DAPM support,
that changes register value in ZL38005 ram.
More than one device is supported changing DEVCOUNT define and populating the
platform data structure.


IOCTL API Funcion
=======================

Reading DMEM Data Memory Register
	ioctl(fd, ZL_RD_DATA_REG, &zl38005_ioctl_par);

Writing (DMEM) Data Memory Register
	ioctl(fd, ZL_WR_DATA_REG, &zl38005_ioctl_par);

Reading (IMEM) Instruction Memory Register
	ioctl(fd, ZL_RD_INSTR_REG, &zl38005_ioctl_par);

Writing (IMEM) Instruction Memory Register
	ioctl(fd, ZL_WR_INSTR_REG, &zl38005_ioctl_par);

Firmware & CGFRegister Update (DownLoad)
	ioctl(fd, ZL_UPDATE, &file_data);

Upload Firmware & CGFRegister
	ioctl(fd, ZL_UPLOAD, &file_data);

Save CGFRegister to Flash-- NOTE: You Lost Old Config
	ioctl(fd, ZL_SAVE_CFGR, 0); 

Read CGFRegister from Ram -- NOTE: FROM RAM 
	ioctl(fd, ZL_READ_CURRENT_CFGR, &file_data);
